# Winnovation

<p align = 'center'><b> Repository for project Winnovation.</b></p>

This is a repository based on the application of Deep learing in the field of action recognition. Here we are focussing on making an app which able to predict **American sign language** based gestures and convert it into a speech transcript or sentence for normal person to understand it.

**Below are some snapshots of the sample sign videos along with the augmentations we had performed**
