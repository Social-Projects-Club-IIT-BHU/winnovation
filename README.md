# Winnovation

<p align = 'center'><b> Repository for project Winnovation.</b></p>

This is a repository based on the application of Deep learing in the field of action recognition. Here we are focussing on making an app which able to predict **American sign language** based gestures and convert it into a speech transcript or sentence for normal person to understand it.

## **Starting Collaboration**
### On local machine

**for Window users**<br>
You can clone this repo using<br> 
`git clone https://github.com Social-Projects-Club-IIT-BHU/winnovation.git `

**for linux users**<br>
It is better to use ssh method for cloning<br>
To know how to integrate ssh with linux use this [link](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-enable-ssh-on-ubuntu-18-04/)<br>
After that use `git@github.com:Social-Projects-Club-IIT-BHU/winnovation.git`

### On Collab

On collab the best recommended method for private repo is to use *ssh based method*. Follow any ssh-github related article or video to start on collab.


## **Task to accomplish**

- [ ] Preprocessing part
- [ ] Model Building
- [ ] Model debugging
- [ ] Model Insights
- [ ] App Development
  
## Objectives for this week upto (10th Dec)

- **Preprocessing Work** - Creating different types of augmentation methods(both simple and advanced) and also talking with app development members for making them understand what they have to do, to code same thing in kotlin or java.
- **Model Building** - All members take one model each from the refernce provid below and modify it for our requirement and make sure that the code is written in keras with tensorflow2 backend and also ensure the code is written in well defined classes just like provided in reference(Note: YOu only just take inspiration from reference because their code is written in pytorch not tensorflow).
- **App development** - Contact with preprocessing work members and develop methods for transforming things in java and kotlin 

**NOTE:** If you stuck anywhere
- Google, till you find it
- If no, raise an issue here in github
- else ask on whatsapp group



## **Refernces---------**

If you find anything useful refernces you can directly coomit add that in the resources folder and attach the links here.

## **Instructions for Contribution:**

 - **For adding codes** - Create a pull request by using a different branch
 - **For adding resources** - you can directly commit in repo but ensure   that the resource is geniune and as per our project requirements.
